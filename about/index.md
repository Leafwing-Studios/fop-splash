## The World

In a world where the dungeons themselves want you dead, **why do you explore?**

In *Fonts of Power*, magic is woven into the fabric of reality: abundant, living, and dangerous. As it coalesces, magic brings life to the land itself, transforming mundane settings into the spectacular, perilous, magical places known as **fonts of power.** Over the centuries, these fonts grow, change and develop a character of their own, amplifying and twisting the essence of their environments.

Hungry for magic, the fonts lure, ensnare and devour foolish **adventurers** like you, fueling their existence in a strangely symbiotic cycle. Deep within their alien microcosms, the hearts of these fonts hold **treasure** beyond your wildest dreams: a bow that fires piercing starlight, a suit of armor that brings its wearer back to life, a paintbrush that alters reality with a flick of the wrist...

But beware! Bizarre and spectacular **monsters** abound, birthed from the elemental magic roiling within each font. Serving as both the font’s immune system and its maw, they will do everything in their power to end your paltry life. For as you fall, your soul’s magic escapes into the font and your hard-won treasures serve only to lure the next party to their doom.

*Fonts of Power’s* emphasis on interesting places takes dungeon-delving to new heights. Fresh but familiar, we’ve put an optimistic, inclusive twist on fantasy classics, adding our own steampunk splash to offer you a retro-modern TTRPG experience that’s bursting with flavor.

No matter what side of the screen you’re sitting on, you deserve to have fun playing *Fonts of Power*. We know how much work learning and running a new system can be, so we’re prioritizing the tools that you need as the **worldspeaker:**
- Premade modules that encourage exploration and creative solutions, each centered around a particular font of power and designed to be plugged into whatever world you build.
- A compendium full of evocative, balanced, and meaningfully distinct monsters, along with the frameworks needed to bring your wildest concepts to life.
- Ready-made tips and tables to inspire the treasures, threats, and clues to be uncovered. These are the raw ingredients for environmental storytelling, prompting your players to discover the world as they play in it.
- Concrete guidelines and tools for making interesting encounters, with vantages to fight over, openings to discover and dynamics that keep the party on their toes.
- A rich and expressive affix system for building strange, wondrous, and balanced magical items, each with their own unique effects and quirks.

## The Game
*Fonts of Power* is an optimistic, innovative entry into the d20 TTRPG genre. Whether you’re a brand new player or an old grognard: **welcome to our table.**

Reimagining the classics from a modern perspective, our system aims to distill the essence of what made those games great. We believe that you can have **tactical combat** without endless modifiers, explore **rich customization** without decision paralysis, enjoy **streamlined mechanics** without homogeneity, and **play to win without leaving anyone behind.**

*Fonts of Power* is made up of simple subsystems that weave together fiction and mechanics, rather than a patchwork of rules designed to simulate a reality-that-never-was. Taken together, these systems create a **rich tapestry of gameplay,** offering depth in decision-making without frustrating confusion.

Our philosophy is to create **emergent complexity** through **meaningful choices.** Explore the game and fall in love with:
- Ten fresh **new species,** from fae to slimes, that showcase meaningful diversity and offer intriguing perks to play with, no matter which class you choose.
- Twelve **original classes** that go beyond the classics, each with a distinctive playstyle and flavor to build your character around.
- Carefully-tuned **tactical combat** that offers meaningful choices each turn, rewarding system mastery and encouraging coordinated tactics as you respond to a dynamic battlefield.
- Explore and shape the world around you with balanced, flavorful choices for **non-combat customization.** Everyone has a role to play: whether they’re winning allies, fighting for their ideals, crafting items, or getting into trouble.
- Create the character of your dreams with impactful **talents** and a streamlined, modular **crafting system,** all supported by modern digital tools to make designing the perfect build fun again.

Tell the story of a new group of heroes with:
- A fast and fair **experience system** that encourages players to **explore** the world, hunt for **treasure,** win the **loyalty** of those around them, fight for the **ideals** they hold dear, and **opt-in to risk.**
- Earn **Resolve** when you opt-in to risk, then spend it to smooth over bad luck or recover the strength needed to press on in the face of danger.
- An above-table system to piece together **hints** using your character’s Insight; making sure that play keeps moving even if something is missed.
- Clear guidelines for skill checks that set up unexpected twists and empower players. Choose between a **setback** or an **opportunity** when you fail a skill check you’re proficient in, or earn a **smashing success** when you go above and beyond.
- A rich system of **downtime activities** that gives meaning and value to the pauses in the adventure, letting players take the lead as they develop their characters’ personalities. Will you **bond** with your allies over cards, **enchant** your gear in the heart of a volcano, or read ancient tomes to **prepare** for the task ahead of you?
- Simple and powerful **scenes** that add fun, well-paced mechanics to critical story moments, whether that’s a wild chase, a carefully-negotiated **deal,** a gruelling test of **attrition,** or a harmless spot of **trickery.**
